        <p>
            The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by
            Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football.

            The history of baseball in the United States dates to the 18th century, when boys and amateur
            enthusiasts played a baseball-like game by their own informal rules using homemade equipment. The popularity of the sport grew and amateur men's ball clubs were formed in the 1830â€“50s.

        <p>
            The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football.
            Both games have their origin in multiple varieties of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th
            century, in which a football is kicked at a goal or kicked over a line, which in turn were based on the
            varieties of English public school football games descending from medieval ball games.
